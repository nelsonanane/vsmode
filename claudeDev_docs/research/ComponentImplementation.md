# Component Implementation Research

## File Tree Sidebar

### Approach:

- Use a recursive component to render the file tree structure
- Implement collapsible folders
- Add icons for different file types

### Potential libraries:

- react-folder-tree
- @blueprintjs/core (Tree component)

### Considerations:

- Performance optimization for large projects
- Drag and drop functionality for file/folder management

## Code Editor

### Approach:

- Use a code editor library that supports syntax highlighting and basic editing features
- Implement a tab system for multiple open files

### Potential libraries:

- Monaco Editor (used in VSCode)
- CodeMirror
- Ace Editor

### Considerations:

- Language support and extensibility
- Performance for large files
- Integration with file tree for opening/saving files

## Terminal

### Approach:

- Implement a terminal emulator that can execute commands
- Integrate with the host system's shell

### Potential libraries:

- xterm.js
- node-pty (for backend process spawning)

### Considerations:

- Security implications of allowing command execution
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Integration with Tauri's API for file system access

## Next Steps:

1. Evaluate and choose appropriate libraries for each component
2. Create basic implementations of each component
3. Integrate components with the main application layout
4. Implement state management for handling open files, active terminal sessions, etc.
