# Sprint 1: Initial Setup

## Goals

- Set up the basic project structure for the VSCode clone
- Implement the initial layout using react-mosaic
- Create placeholder components for main features

## Tasks

1. [x] Set up Tauri project with React
2. [x] Add Tailwind CSS to the project
3. [x] Install react-mosaic for flexible layout
4. [x] Create initial project structure with basic components
5. [x] Implement basic layout using react-mosaic
6. [ ] Test the application (user action required)
7. [ ] Create file tree sidebar (placeholder)
8. [ ] Develop basic code editor functionality (placeholder)
9. [ ] Integrate terminal component (placeholder)

## Challenges

- Ensuring proper integration between Tauri, React, and Tailwind CSS

## Next Steps

- User to test the application and provide feedback
- Implement actual functionality for file tree, code editor, and terminal
- Begin work on tab system for file navigation
- Start designing the settings panel

## Notes

- Current setup provides a good foundation for further development
- Need to consider how to handle state management as the application grows
- Should research best practices for integrating AI capabilities in the future
